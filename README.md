# find-me-on-github
I have developed a react-redux project with sagas using github open source api, which provides a search functionality and displays user details on github.  

Steps for local setup:
1. npm i to install required modules.
2. npm start
3. open http://localhost:3000/ in browser

Feats:
1. Landing Page: Search functionality for github users. (Ex; Search 'imsam7')
2. User Route: Display user details of github user.
3. Repositories Route: Display repos of the user on clicking Repositories.
4. Following Route: Display following of the user on clicking Following.
5. Followers Route: Display follower of the user on clicking Followers.
